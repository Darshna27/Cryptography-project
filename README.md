Image Encryption Decryption using AES-256-CBC Algorithm 
###Image Encryption and Decryption

This project is a web-based platform for securely encrypting and decrypting images using the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) algorithm. Key features include:

- **User-Friendly Interface:** Simple upload, encrypt, and decrypt processes.
- **AES Encryption:** Robust encryption and decryption using AES.
- **Secure Uploads and Downloads:** Maintains encryption during transit and storage.
- **Customizable Settings:** Adjustable encryption parameters.
- **Access Controls:** Prevents unauthorized access.

This project emphasizes manual AES implementation for better control and understanding of cryptographic processes, ensuring data security in digital healthcare communications.
